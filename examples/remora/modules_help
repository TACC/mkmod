-------------------------- Module Specific Help for remora/$VER  --------------------------
REMORA is an easy to use profiler that allows users to get information
regarding their jobs. The information collected by the tool includes:
    - Memory usage
    - CPU usage
    - I/O load (Lustre,DVS)
    - NUMA memory
    - Network topology

To use the tool, simply modify your batch script and include 'remora' before
your executable or ibrun.

Examples:
...
#SBATCH -N 2
#SBATCH -n 16
#SBATCH -A my_project

remora ibrun my_parallel_program [arguments]

---------------------------------------
...
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH -A my_project
remora ./my_program [arguments]

---------------------------------------

REMORA will create a set of folders with a number of files that contain
the values for the parameters previously introduced.

REMORA will also create a set of HTML files with the results plotted for
an easier analysis. There's a summary HTML file in the main results folder
that contains links to the different results. Transfer the results to your
own machine to visualize them.

The following environment variables control the behaviour of the tool:

  - REMORA_PERIOD  - How often memory usage is checked. Default
                     is 10 seconds.
  - REMORA_VERBOSE - Verbose mode will save all information to
                     a file. Default is 0 (off).
  - REMORA_MODE    - FULL for all stats, BASIC for memory and cpu only.
                     Default if FULL.
  - REMORA_TMPDIR  - Directory for intermediate files. Default is the
                     remora output directory.

The remora module also defines the following environment variables:
REMORA_DIR, REMORA_LIB, REMORA_INC and REMORA_BIN for the location
of the REMORA distribution, libraries, include files, and tools respectively.

To generate a summary report after a crash use:

remora_post_crash <JOBID>
